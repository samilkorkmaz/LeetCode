# LeetCode
Method for solving problems:
1. Divide the problem sub-problems and convert them into functions, don't worry about function implementation at this step. Example (for C++): findNbIOfOccurances(string s, char c)
2. Handle special cases. Examples: x > INT_MAX/10, s = "IX"
3. Implement functions.
